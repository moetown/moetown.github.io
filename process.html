						    <h3>Research</h3>
						    <p>in my experience, the first step of every project involves various steps of research. Depending on how thourough you want to go, you can do many different activites to understand the users general needs, pain points in their workflow, and any problems they might have.</p>

						  <h2>Why, why, why</h2>
						  <div class="blog-meta">Understanding the context</div>
						  <p>Every new project has variables. Timeframes, requests, visual requirements, stakeholders, style and much more. I try to keep it simple and intially understand why there's a problem to solve.</p>
						  <p>My job is to make the users needs met through design. Sometimes, as you might have experienced, business and user needs might diverege for a various number of reasons. My role therefor involves a lot of communication, collaboration, and quick problem solving to build empathy and understanding for the user, what their world looks like and their problems as well as understanding the business they're in.</p>

						  <h2>The problem to solve</h2>
						  <div class="blog-meta">How do we know where to start</div>
						  <p>The next thing to figure out is what problem to solve, because there might be many, and how do we know what the users really consider is the most prominent problem? Who are even our users?<br>
					      </p>
						  <p>This is where running workshops, interviews, observation studies, and listen-ins becomes a crucial part of my role. To understand what the problems are, where they occur and what the most annoying painpoints are. I've runned interviews both in person and on remote, which both has their pros and cons ofcourse. Lookback, Zoom and Quicktime has been helpful for me to run and sometimes record the sessions.</p>

						  <h2>Our users</h2>
						  <div class="blog-meta">What is the users current workflow and how do they solve their everyday problems </div>
						  <p>Synthesising our user insights into presentable content is a way to better understand where they're coming from and why they might need something in a given context. <br>
					      </p>
						  <p>Personas and user journeys based on those is a great way to show how the product is working in their context and where the tools fall short to sufficiently fill their needs, plus the impact it has in terms of frustrations. Personas, in my mind, represent a frequently occuring group of users who has similar traits, needs and behaviours for instance. A generalisation to easier understand differences and thereby how to solve for those. In journeys we see how those groups behave as they move about in the product and what they're thinking, feeling and doing.</p>

						    <h3>Ideation</h3>
						    <p>Next step would be a brainstorming session with the team to map out flows, ideas and journeys based on the research insights. The whiteboard is a designers best friend! (Or Miro, when working remote). The output should be a hypothetical design for POC.</p>

						  <p>From my experience, a product team has more fun together while working synchronised and informed in the same direction. So when we've looked at the research insights together, our different experiences could provide many different solutions to how to solve the problem at hand.</p>
						  <p>Workshopping on a whiteboard, with postits or in Miro would be my way of getting the ideation going. The size of the project determines how thourough we should be!</p>

						    <h3>Validation</h3>
						    <p>Useful ways of quickly validating our POC would be through either using paper mockups or a prototype in Invision. I'd typically interview the user at the same time and ask them to walk me through their process and thinking, while observing their interactions.</p>

						  <h2>What do our users think</h2>

						  <p>I have experience doing both usability testing with an interactive prototype whilst being in the room and observing the user as well as doing the testing remote over Lookback and Zoom. The scope of the project will determine how thourough you need to be here, but obviously any facial expressions and interactions are easier observed irl. <br>
					      </p>
						  <p>Any feedback gathered can be summarized in a test report to build insights for possible iterations, I've also most often asked to record the session to be able to debrief properly afterwards. EnjoyHQ is an excellent tool for this.</p>

						    <h3>Design &amp; build</h3>
						    <p>When a set number of target users has validated the design, we're in a go/no go state. Either i need to iterate the design with user feedback or proceed to do final UI. After releasing, I typically check google analytics and any user feedback for improvement.</p>

						  <h2>Designing UI</h2>
						  <div class="blog-meta">Getting into the pixels</div>
						  <p>In this stage I like to create a few mockups in Sketch or Figma and share with the team. I've found Abstract useful for working in a remote context with teams across the globe, especially for version control, but I've found Figma getting better and better and much enjoymed that too. Especially the ease of having everything in the cloud. <br>
					      </p>
						  <p>When having something more final to show I present this internally for stakeholders as well as the team, and we can quickly get any tweaks done together. Working close with devs and testers have been great for me during this phase. When the design is final, I help with the specification for the build as well as follow up regularly with developers on the progress and any tweaks. </p>
